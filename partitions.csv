# Note: "FATFS" usually refers to using the FFat library on a partition. 
# PlatformIO usually labels 'fatfs' partitions as 'data, fat' or just uses a custom partition type.
# However, for compatibility with typical "FATFS" usage in Arduino ESP32, we often use a specific data partition.
# If the user specifically wants 9.9MB FATFS, we can define it. 
# 0x9E0000 hex is approx 10.3 MB. 
# 16MB = 0x1000000 bytes.
# 3MB = 0x300000 bytes.
# nvs (20KB) + otadata (8KB) + 2x app (6MB total) = ~6MB used.
# Remaining for data = ~10MB.
# Let's align to the user's specific "3MB APP / 9.9MB FATFS" request.
# 3MB app0.
# The user might not want OTA (2x apps). "3MB APP" often implies a single factory app or simplified scheme, OR 2 apps of 3MB. 
# Standard "Huge App" is often 3MB.
# Let's assume standard OTA scheme with 3MB slots.
# Top of flash: 16MB.
